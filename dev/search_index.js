Paralelism introduces stochasticity and thus debugging a feeback loop or the part which learns in such system is painful. On the other hand we have so many different kinds of systems which implments paralelism - processes, threads, GPUs, job schedulers, GRID and etc. And so one ends up writting non-rusable code a case by a case.","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"A TaskMater is an abstraction for all of thoose issues. A two important concepts are used for such system - Master and Learner. Master is a process which takes input values from a channel Master.tasks and evaluates in an arbitrary fashion/order and puts that in Master.results channel as a tuple (input,output). One make a concrete implementation which usses processes, threads, GPUs, TPUs, job scheduler and etc for evaluation. Or one can treat Master as some process which commes from an experimental equipment, for example, from a multihead scanning tuneling microscope. Or one could try to find optimal parameters for plant growth where paralelism is very natural.","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"The other concept it Learner which tries to learn from the Master by learner asking questions and master telling answers. The nature is that master has multiple questions an he answers them in arbitrary order. Thus the learner needs to be smart to optimize the objective. Again the learner could be a computer program, animal (if you can teach them paralelism), or a human pressing buttons.","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"Particularly in the case of a computer program there are quite a variety. There is a class of learners where programmer had programmed all cases how the system should behave. A very great example is made by my Python collegues in adaptive package which allows adaptive function evaluation for reducing computational needs to make a nice figure (see Adaptive.jl for a wrapper). Other type of learners had been brainstrormed in this issue. The other class which might gain a traction is a machine learned learner, for example, a plant state recognition algorthm with some ML to optimize the growth.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Interface-1","page":"Introduction","title":"Interface","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"For what follows we need to load and execute","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"using Distributed\naddprocs(2)","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"before loading TaskMaster.
