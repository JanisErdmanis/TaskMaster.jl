# A very daunting thing to programm is a feedback loop with paralelism. Paralelism introduces stochasticity and thus debugging a feeback loop or the part which learns in such system is painful. On the other hand we have so many different kinds of systems which implments paralelism - processes, threads, GPUs, job schedulers and etc. And so one ends up writting non-rusable code a case by a case.

# A TaskMater is an abstraction for all of thoose problems. A three concepts allows to achieve such
